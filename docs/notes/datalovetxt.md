# Datalove.txt


After some SSL issues on the [https://www.deadbits.org/hax/datalove.txt](https://www.deadbits.org/hax/datalove.txt) page, I make here a copy to be sure not to loose such treasure.


```plain text
One day, in the future that we project ourselves into, AT&TLantis shall no longer need burrows.
But until then, we meet in the dark tunnels.
Inside the fiberoptic maze,
or on the subterranean dancefloors.

==========================

THE PRINCIPLES OF DATALOVE

| Love data
| Data is essential
| Data must flow
| Data must be used
| Data is neither good nor bad
| There is no illegal data
| Data is free
| Data can not be owned
| No man, machine or system shall interrupt the flow of data
| Locking data is a crime against datanity
| Love data

===========================
Datalove means connecting one node to another, via other nodes. When you say "hi" to someone, and that person replies "oh hi", you have made datalove. When you use a technological system of any sort to transport those messages, that system becomes the object of the extended binary data love.

Datalove is sacred. You worship it everytime you look into someone's eyes, and make that person your ally; when you together start tying together trajectories of imagination and reality; when you project into the future a common idea or plan. Throw yourselves into the unknown as a meshwork. Borrow everything! Then burrow it! Copy it! Assemble all that is needed for the utopia, for the resurrection of the lost data once sheltered in the city of AT&Lantis!

Datalove has no negation. There is no data hate. The negation of data is encrypted data, ciphertext. But ciphertext is pure positivity.
