# C4 Model for Architecture Diagrams


information shared by a colleague. Keeping this info here.


 


The C4 Model is a simple way to structure architecture diagrams without overcomplicating things. It has four key views:

- System Context ([link](https://c4model.com/diagrams/system-context)) – Big picture: the system, its users, and external dependencies.
- Container ([link](https://c4model.com/diagrams/container)) – Breakdown of the system into key components.
- Deployment ([link](https://c4model.com/diagrams/deployment)) – Where things run (servers, cloud, etc.).
- Dynamic ([link](https://c4model.com/diagrams/dynamic)) – How components interact over time.

Keeps things clear without getting lost in UML.
