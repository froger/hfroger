- OSS Strategies to build trust are organized in three pillars
	- License
	- Security
	- **Resilience**

So what are the indicators for the software for resilience?

- Community Activity
	- 85% of OSS project are inactive.
		- comment: is it noise? or a needed thing for emergence.
		- this situation lead to have attackers that inject malicious code inside packages. It's called Solarwind attacks

Metrics:

- SBOMs: [https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/10/25/the-ultimate-guide-to-sboms/](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/10/25/the-ultimate-guide-to-sboms/)
	- Expiration date: if a package do not receive updates for X time, label it
	- as Deps uses deps, we need to have an Inventory, a SBOM
	- It's a MUST HAVE to have an inventory Exec. Order in US and Cyber sercurity act in EU

Note on the contributor absence: indicate if there is many people changing the code. It's about differences btw number of contributions.
