> ## What is ISO/IEC 27001?
>
>
> ISO/IEC 27001 isÂ the world's best-known standard for **information security management systems (ISMS)**. It defines requirements an ISMS must meet.
>
>
> The ISO/IEC 27001 standard provides companies of any size and from 
> all sectors of activity with guidance for establishing, implementing, 
> maintaining and continually improving an information security management
>  system.
>
>
> Conformity with ISO/IEC 27001 means that an organization or business 
> has put in place a system to manage risks related to the security of 
> data owned or handled by the company, and that this system respects all 
> the best practices and principles enshrined in this International 
> Standard.
>
>
> ## Why is ISO/IEC 27001 important?
>
>
> With cyber-crime on the rise and **new threats** **constantly emerging**,
>  it can seem difficult or even impossible to manage cyber-risks. ISO/IEC
>  27001 helps organizations become risk-aware and proactively identify 
> and address weaknesses.
>
>
> ISO/IEC 27001 promotes a holistic approach to information security: 
> vetting people, policies and technology. An information security 
> management system implemented according to this standard is a tool for **risk management, cyber-resilience** and **operational excellence.**
