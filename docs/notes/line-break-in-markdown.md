# Line break in markdown


[https://szymonkrajewski.pl/line-break-in-markdown/](https://szymonkrajewski.pl/line-break-in-markdown/)


## **Two spaces**


 **Two spaces** at the end of the line also produce a line break.


`This is the first line{space}{space}
And this is another line...`


I don’t use to split paragraphs across multiple lines. That’s why I don’t need any particular indicator that tells me there is a line break. The actual line break is sufficient for me by itself.
