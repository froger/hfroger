# Risk Assessment for Illegal Content


From Decidim community, [https://matrix.to/#/!WbkoamENosPmKRcBfm:matrix.org/$5GoT-G2Xs2iPZKapeBgxhEGnCMVnmi6937a0sbqWqHA?via=matrix.org&via=gitter.im&via=privchat.eu](https://matrix.to/#/!WbkoamENosPmKRcBfm:matrix.org/$5GoT-G2Xs2iPZKapeBgxhEGnCMVnmi6937a0sbqWqHA?via=matrix.org&via=gitter.im&via=privchat.eu)

> It applies for any communities (user to user) who have UK users: [https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/guide-for-services/](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/online-safety/illegal-and-harmful-content/guide-for-services/) - if you don't have under 18s and don't do pornography then mostly what you need to do is a risk assessment, and have a record keeping system, providing the systems you use for user-to-user communication have the appropriate systems in place for reporting illegal/harmful content, at least that is my understanding. The important thing here is you must start the risk assessment soon, by mid-March 2025.

From what I understand, it is more import to do risk assessment than already changing the product. As changing the product would be a mitigation to a risk. It would be useful to have a living document to iterate around these assessments.
