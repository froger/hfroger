# Single Page Assembly

## Purpose


Decidim is quiet a huge data architecture, and does not fit well for very small group that wnat to have their own space.


So this project is to explore how an assembly could be serve as a standalone page, under its own domain name.


## Will be done when


When a small association can use decidim customizing their own color, without having a general Decidim bloated of custom colors.


## Updates


**dec/2024**: created a mockup to send offers and implement the feature. estimated the work.
