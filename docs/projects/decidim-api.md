#  Decidim API

## Purpose


Other tools can work with a decidim instance through a generated client. The clients can be anything (Node/Python/PHP). 


## Will be done when


Interoperability can be made through the main decidim components: blogs, pages, proposals, and meetings.


## Updates 


**jan/2025** We have a first proof of concept done


**feb/2025** We are done with proposals and user extended data. We will introduce a DSL to write the openapi specs (RFC: [https://git.octree.ch/decidim/decidim-chatbot/decidim-module-rest_full/-/issues/2](https://git.octree.ch/decidim/decidim-chatbot/decidim-module-rest_full/-/issues/2))
